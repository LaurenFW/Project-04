# Project-04

Under Construction
Brief insight from C.V - Project Four: Individual Project, Voyage  
Timeframe: 8 days - Technologies Used: CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python and PostgreSQL
The brief on this project was to create a full-stack application. My main idea was for users to be able to search for cruises by destination, regions or ship - Where they were then able to see what is onboard the cruise ship and a description of the area. I decided that I really wanted to do my final project on my own to concentrate on doing my own API and to test myself.
